== Translated script

*Pg4* +
*B:* But actually, what a weird restaurant, huh?

*B:* "A restaurant where you can eat your troubles..."

*B:* What, // do you have a problem with the concept of my restaurant? +
*B:* Not a problem, just my thoughts. // You're scary.

*Pg5* +
*B:* So, uh, // somebody asked me a question... +
*B:* I had a really hard time answering.

*B:* But in the end, I told the truth.

*B:* Which made them really angry, // and they just let out their pent-up frustration at me... +
*B:* All I did was tell the truth, you know?

*B:* All that deep-seated jealousy and obsession... what a scary person. // I don't know what to do now... +
*SFX:* Plunk

*B:* Sigh, poor me... +
*SFX:* Stir stir

*Pg6* +
*B:* In short, you're stuck as to how to calm that person down-- // that's what's troubling you? +
*B:* Yeah.

*B:* By the way,

*B:* You kinda remind me of them.

*B:* Bruh.

*Pg7* +
*B:* You knew they'd be upset but still told the truth, // so you're finding a way to calm them down, right?

*B:* ...Yeah.

*B:* It's not acceptable to not answer sincerely when asked a question, right? +
*B:* That's not just naïve idealism, // it's a reality that nobody wants, // more than anything.

== Edited script

*Pg4* +
*B:* This really is a strange business, isn't it?

*B:* "A restaurant where you can eat your troubles..."

*B:* What? // Do you have a problem with the concept? +
*B:* I don't have a problem. I'm simply voicing my thoughts. // You're scary.

*Pg5* +
*B:* So, uh... // somebody asked me a question recently... +
*B:* that I had a hard time answering.

*B:* But in the end, I told them the truth.

*B:* It made them angry, // and they vented their pent-up frustration at me... +
*B:* All I did was tell the truth, you know?

*B:* All that deep-seated jealousy and obsession... What a scary person. // I don't know what to do now... +
*SFX:* Plop

*B:* Ahhh, poor me... +
*SFX:* Stir stir

*Pg6* +
*B:* In short, you don't know how to calm that person down... // That's what's troubling you? +
*B:* That's right.

*B:* By the way,

*B:* you kinda remind me of them.

*B:* You...

*Pg7* +
*B:* You knew they'd be upset but still told the truth, // so you're trying to find a way to calm them down now, right?

*B:* ...Yeah.

*B:* It's not acceptable to give an insincere answer when you're asked a question, right? +
*B:* That's not just naïve idealism: it's reality. // Nobody wants to acknowledge it, but that's what it is, // more than anything else.
