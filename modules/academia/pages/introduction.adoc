= Academic Writing Samples

This section houses writing samples from my academic career.
I completed my undergraduate degree in 2019, and my master's degree in 2020.

While the samples here do represent the topics I am most interested in, they are only brief excerpts of longer papers.
I do provide context for each sample, but they must stand on their own.

All citations use MLA 8 format.
