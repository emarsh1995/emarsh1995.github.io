= Nylas: Using Nylas ExtractAI

== Context

This excerpt is taken from xref:https://docs.nylas.com/docs/v3/extract-ai/[Using Nylas ExtractAI].
I worked with the Engineering team to draft and release this documentation alongside Nylas' new ExtractAI product when it launched in August 2024.

== Sample

=== Activate ExtractAI

First, enable ExtractAI for your application:

. Log in to the Nylas v3 Dashboard and select your application.
. Click menu:Activate ExtractAI[Enable ExtractAI].

WARNING: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Nylas automatically creates a Pub/Sub channel when you enable ExtractAI**.
This channel is subscribed to the ExtractAI triggers (`message.intelligence.tracking` and `message.intelligence.order`) by default, and you don't need to further configure it.
_Do not_ delete the channel from the Notifications page.
If you do, _the ExtractAI APIs will not work_.

Now, you can connect to an end user's email account by xref:https://docs.nylas.com/docs/v3/quickstart/#create-a-test-grant[authenticating a grant], and begin checking for order and tracking information.
You can either xref:https://docs.nylas.com/docs/v3/extract-ai/order-consolidation-api/[make API requests] periodically to fetch updated information from Nylas, or xref:set-up-extractai-notifications[get notifications] when the end user receives email messages that meet ExtractAI's requirements.

=== Set up ExtractAI notifications

ExtractAI can generate notifications when a user receives an email message containing information about an e-commerce order or shipment. To set this up...

. In the Nylas Dashboard, select **Notifications** from the left navigation.
. Click **Create webhook** and add a **name** for the notification settings.
. Enter your **Webhook URL**. This is where Nylas sends webhook notifications (also called a "callback URL"). This URL must direct to an HTTPS endpoint that's accessible from the public internet.
. Enable the **ExtractAI** triggers (`message.intelligence.tracking` and `message.intelligence.order`).
. Click **Create webhook**.

Nylas sends a confirmation notification to your webhook URL. If you don't receive the confirmation notification, make sure you entered your **Webhook URL** correctly.

When your webhook is set up, Nylas automatically starts generating notifications for email messages that contain order or shipment information.
See the xref:https://docs.nylas.com/docs/v3/notifications/notification-schemas/#extractai-notifications[Notification schemas documentation] for schema examples.

NOTE: üîç **Nylas extracts data for grants authenticated before you set up ExtractAI webhooks only**.
If you want to get up to 30 days of historical email messages, you must authenticate your end users _after_ you configure webhooks for ExtractAI.
