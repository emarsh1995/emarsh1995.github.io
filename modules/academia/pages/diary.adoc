= Diary of an Unknown Gentleman

== Context

This sample comes from an April 2020 paper that I wrote for a course exploring the cataloging of time in personal diaries.
It discusses a diary written by an anonymous 19th century Englishman which found its way to the Queen's University archives.
The diary was maintained from September 1835 through July 1839, and was used for two purposes: as a journal, and as a commonplace book.

For my discussion of the text, I have formatted my references according to the diary's structure: (J)ournal and \(C)ommonplace book (for example, J.13).

This excerpt focuses on the author's fascination with ruins that he encounters.
Abandoned churches and run-down graveyards feature in both sections of his diary, and hint at an underlying solemnity and interest in mortality.

All quotes from the diary are transcribed from the original manuscript housed in the Queen's University archives.

Examining the poetry that the writer included in his diary is interesting; not only does the reader get to see the modifications the writer made to his works--the physical traces of him having scratched words out and replaced them using pen or pencil (see <<physical-editing,Figure 1>>) or of him having glued pages into the diary's binding (see <<glued-paper,Figure 2>>)—one can also compare the themes in his poetry to the contents of his journal entries.
The feelings of being displaced may arise from his need to travel for work, which pulled him away from his family and those dear to him--especially during 1835, when the writer's father was in his sickbed and he was receiving updates via latter, as he could not be by his father's side.
This may also be where his fascination with mortality comes from: knowing that a close family member may die at any time might have caused him to think more deeply on life and death.
That fascination also may have come from his personal interest in reading memoirs; he notes early on in his journal that he has read many such books--although he clearly identifies the most with Byron'sfootnote:Byron["Read the 6th & concluding volume of Byron's life--his death peculiarly affecting--I do not want to set him up as my model either in letter or Morals, but cannot cease to admire & love his character. Certainly of all the memoirs of individuals, distinguished or otherwise, Byron is the one with whom I am at home with & sympathize & feel deeply every circumstance connected with him--as tho I experienced them in myself--" (J.2–3)].
Imagery of abandoned, ruined churches and church yards is recurrent as well, as in the poem titled "The Village Cross":

[verse,C.4]
____
--But now no other relic here
Beside this ruined broken stone,
The latest token left--alone—
In memory of forgotten prayer.
____

The piece as a whole focuses on a ruined cross in a village square where a church used to stand.
Everything besides the cross has fallen to ruin, leaving only the remains of a church spire standing alongside the moss-covered relic.
There is a similar fascination reflected in the journal, wherein he described visits to ruined churches on days when he did not have personal appointments.
