= Academic writing samples

This section contains writing samples from my Masters degree, which I completed in 2020.
While the samples here do represent the topics I'm most interested in, they're only brief excerpts of much longer papers.
I do my best to provide context for each sample, but they must stand on their own.

All citations use MLA 8 format.
